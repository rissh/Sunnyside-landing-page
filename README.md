### What I learned

How to remove the gap between two inline-block divs:

```html
  <div class="skills">
    <div class="graphic-design">
      <h2>Graphic design</h2>
      <p>
        Great design makes you memorable. We deliver artwork that
        underscores your brand message and captures potential clientsâ€™
        attention.
      </p>
    </div><!--
    --><div class="photography">
      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        Increase your credibility by getting the most stunning, high-quality
        photos that improve your business image.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
```
